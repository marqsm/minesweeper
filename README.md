Minesweeper
===========

General
-------
This is a simple JS implementation of minesweeper.

I made it mainly as a part of my application to hacker school. It also became the first project to use Malabi, my little underscore-ish library (which I still don't recommend anybody to use in its current state of (im)maturity). I ended up writing it out, and opted for using ES5 features.

It has only been tested on chrome, and theoretically should only run on IE9+ as it needs ES5 support.

The code is the result of a couple of evenings of coding. So if you find something silly in the code, please just tell me or send me a pull request if you're feeling more active.
